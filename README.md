This repository contains FME workbenches from the submitted manuscript "An integrated BIM-GIS Approach for Representation and Visualization of 3D Cadastre". The original IFC-file used in the study cannot be published. We have instead created an FME FFS-file with the logical spaces (IfcSpaces) and one FFS-file with a LOD2 building model of the building.

Workbenches:

brygganIFC_2_CityGML3_GitHUB.fmwt - Convert IFC to CityGML data (Section 4.5 in article)
LADMDB_CityGML_Workbench.fmwt - Connect and visualize CityGML and LADM at city level (Section 4.6 in article)
